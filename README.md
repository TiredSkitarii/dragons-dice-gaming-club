## A tabletop Gaming Club running regular gaming sessions and events

A Website for a local Tabletop Gaming Club based in the town of Portishead. The Website features ~~images of the games run by the event~~, an explanation of the clubs goals and standards, a timetable of the Clubs regular activities and a page with upcoming major events being run by the club. The Primary two goals of the website is to advertise the club to convince new members to sign up, as well as provide information on upcoming events for existing club members.

The scale of the club is a few dozen members, enough to represent the local area, and is not intended to run as a "business". Consequently, while the Club does have Business Goals, they are conserneerd with maintaining and growing Club Activity rather than providing a service, and so the club's website is stuctured accordingly.

The Buisness Goals of the Website are:
- Build Awareness of the Dragon's Dice Gaming Club and what it does
- Convince new members to join up for club activities
- Display a list of upcoming events for new and old members, with a link to sign up for the event

The Customer Goals are:
- Learn more about the Gaming Club, including ehen and where it meets
- Learn about what activities and events the Gaming Club runs
- Easy procerss to sign up to the club or request more information

## UX

### Ideal user
There are two types of ideal user for this website - a New Visitor and an Existing Member. However, of the two, the New Visitor is the priority focus of the site, as existing Members can be expected to already know many of the details about the Clib, and only be visiting the site for updates on the Events page, while a New Visitor represents a potential new member to the club.

**The ideal New User:**
- A Tabletop Games player who engages with one or more gaming systems
- Disposable income (so they can afford the club fees)
- enough free time to be able to attend activities

**A Visitor to this site is looking for:**
- A gaming club they can join to play tabletop games
- information on both the club itself and any events being run

**This project acheives these goals by:**
- Providing information on the Club and what it offers a prospective new member
- Details on the Clubs' regular activities, including a timetable
- A link to a simple contact form to sign up to the club
- A seperate page detailing upcoming events being run by the club, with links to sign up for the event

## Features

Each page features a Responsive Navigation bar (Nav Bar) that collapses on smaller screens. The Clubs Logo is positioned on the left side of the bar and contains a link which leads back to the homepage, with the navigation links on the right hand side. The Nav Links collapse into the classic "Burger" icon on smaller screens, and the active page is highlighted on the Nav Bar.

**Home**

The Home page, referred to as the Index page within the code, is the main page of the website, and serves the main purpose of providing all the information about the club for prospective new members.

~~After an introductory, welcoming paragraph, the Header of the Home page contains a Carousel of Images featuring images of several of the game systems that are available to be played at the club. The intention of the image carousel is to catch viewers interest, and prompt them to keep viewing the webpage if they see anything that interests them.
While Autoplayng Carosels are not generally advised due to accessibility reasons, one is included here because the trade off of being able to show several eye-catching images in a single section of screen space is considered acceptable in the context of the website - namely being that of a fairly small gaming club.~~
Unfortunately, it became necessary to remove the carousel as the images, as photos, did not meet the assessment criteria for marking this project. If this was a real webpage then we would keep the carousel as it serves a useful purpose in generating interest and promoting the activities of the club. The relatively poor quality of the images would not be an issue, as the website is not intended to be a professional website, and as such the "amatuerish" nature of the images are in keeping with the theme of the site.

The next section is titled "About Us" and is a explanatory paragraph outlining the general purpose of the club - providing a communal environment for tabletop gamers to play games together - and providing an example of some of the many games systems supported at the club. It also outlines the Charity work done by the Club, as well as offering a call to action to submit any questions using the contact link in the Nav bar
This section includes a Stock Image of people playing a Card Game before a new section detailing the Club's values and commitment to inclusivity.
finaly, the section concludes with a breakdown of the benefits of membership of the club, the costs involved, and ends with a call to action with a button linking to the contact form to sign up to the club

The following section contains information on the clubs regular meeting place, St Mary's hall - a Village hall rented by the club. As well as two images of the exterior and interior of the hall, the section also includes a description of the facilities available at the hall, as well as information relavant to club gaming activities (the availability of terrain to use)

The final section of the main element details the clubs regular activities, explaining what those activities ential and providing a timetable displaying what days and at what times the activties run. There is also a breif disclaimer about entry fees for non-members (intended to promote joining the club as a way to save money on regular attendance)

The Homepage is closed out by a footer, which has the address of St Mary's Hall, a contact phone number for the club and a contact email, as well as links to the clubs Social Media pages on Facebook and Instagram.

**Events**

The Events page contains a brief introduction to the types of events run by Dragon's Dice Gaming Club, including more information on the Charity Events run by the club, and a call to action to sign up to any events using the buttons on the Event Cards.

A List of Cards containing details on upcoming events is then displayed. the list is responsive to screen size, and each card contains the Event's title, the date it is running, an image, a brief description of the event and a link that leads to the contact form page so users can sign up to events.

the Events page is also closed off by the same footer as the Home page

**Contact Form**

The Contact form is a standardised form that allows users to message Dragon's Dice gaming club, to join the club, join an event, sign up for the newsletter or even just ask a question.

The Contact form consists of four fields, all of which are required to successfully submit the form - the Users name, a contact email address for them, the reason for contacting them, and the content of the message itself - all of these are text fields are text entry fields, except for the contact reason, which is a drop down listing the most common reasopns for contact: Sign up to club, sign up for Newsletter, Sign up for an event or Question/other message.
All the entry fields are mandatory, which prevents an incomplete form being submitted.
Filling out and Submiting the form through the Submit button will take the user to the Success page.

The Contact form does not contain the usual footer, as it is not a "main" webpage - rather than contain information to be browsed, it has a direct purpose in enabling contact with the Club's admin team, so is focused solely on that.

**Success**

The Success Page is a simple page acknowledng the successful submission of the Contact Form, and prompting the User to return to the Home page via a link.

Like the Contact page, the Successpage also does not have a footer.

### Active Features

- **Home Logo:** Part of the Nav Bar on every page, allows user to recognise the Club Logo. Links back to homepage as per convention.
- **Header Nav Bar:** Appears on every page, provides a conventionally recognisable and intuitive form of Navigation.
- **Footer Contact info:** Appears on the Home and Events page, allows user to locate the venue and contact the club administrators.
- **Footer Social Links:** Appears on the Home and Events page, allows user to access social platforms the Club is on.
- **Call to Action Buttons:** Present on every page, in some form. Acts as a prompt to allow users to interact with the club
- ~~**Home Page Carousel:** adds visual appeal by displaying club actvities, engaging the interest of potential users.~~
- **Club Information:** gives information on the Club to prospective users
- **Location Information:** gives information on the location of the club to prospective users
- **Timetable:** sets out when the regular activities at the club occur, allowing potential users to plan their visits to the club
- **Events Cards:** Clearly set out individual events being run by the club, with a breif outline and a call to action to allow for users to easily join the event
- **Contact Form:** A clear and straightforward form to allow for users to contact the Club, to perform any of the actions they have been previouslty prompted to do.

### Additonal Features to add in future

  - News page: a page offering several articles from the Club's Monthly Newsletter, with a link to sign up to the Newsletter via the Content page. this waould also entail expandingf the Nav Bar to accomodate a new main page. This was not implemented due to timing constraints.
  - Re-adding the carousel at some point in the future would be nice - it worked and served a useful purpose, losing it for what it feels are arbitary aesthetic reasons is disappointing

All Code was also validates using the online W3C HTML Validator and CSS Validator - no errors were discovered during this Validation.

When subjectesd to Lighthouse testing, a lag in performance of about 66 on mobile and 75 on Desktop (all other metrics tested well) - upon looking into ways to improve this, it was detrermines (with help from Brian Macharia) that large image sizes may be contributing to the issue - all JPEG images were re-formatted into smaller WEBP images with less pixels. This improved the score of the mobile load to 73 on mobile (no discernable effect on desktop), but was still slower than was ideal. On further review, it was determined that the images could be perhaps made smaller still, but constraints with time prevented this being implemented. For now the performance score must remain as it is, but if carried on in future, this project would look to decrease the image sizes further to promote faster loading.
(A contributing factor to the images large size may be that many of them were photographs, and thus not optimised for digital display)
After removing the carousel images, another Lighthouse test was run again, with a significant dip in performance on Mobile to 58, but an Improvement in Desktop to about 89. In an effort to combat this, the image size of the Event Cards  and the Town Hall imaged on the main page was reduced further, which improved the load time to 81 - unfortunately, the image size of the remaining images on the Main page could not be reduced without severely affecting the image quality, which would drop the images bewlow the critera for acceptance, so were forced to remain at their current sizes. On Desktop, the score for the desktop improved to 98.

### User Experience

the webpages was tested on the following criteria for the User Experience:

| Test Label | Test Criteria | Test Result |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Navigation | Is Navigating the page clear and intuitive? | The page follows that standard convention for site Navigation, using a Nav Bar at the top of the page. all Links are clearly labeled and direct the user to where they say|
| Text Readability | Is the Text clear and Readable | All Text fonts used are sized enough to be readable on all screen sizes - the Font used for headings is stylised, but remains clearly legible |
| Colour Contrast | Are all colours used well contrasted? | All Colours used contrast with each other to remain legible - text colours switrch to remain visible with different background colours used |
| Consistency | Does the website amintain a consistent style and behaviour? | The Website follows the same visual style throughout all the pages and all interactive features (buttons, etc.) work as presented as would be logically expected of them |
| Form | Is the Form simple and easy to use? | The Form is limited to four areas, each with a clear label for what it does and is set up to allow only the required input (e.g the email field will not accept non-email text )|

### Browser Compatibility

The Webpage was tested on the following Browsers:
- Google Chrome
- Mirosoft Edge
- Firefox
- Safari

On all tests browsers the manual tests were repeated, and on all browsers they passed the tests

### Responsiveness

The webpage was tested for responsiveness on the following screen sizes:
- Mobile (360 x 740 approx)
- Tablet (1024 x 1366 approx)
- Laptop/Desktop screen (1920 x 1080 approx)

On all sizes tests, the layout changed to match that determined by the code breakpoints. One area was identifies where the layout was less than opitimal on Screen Sizes between 992px and 768px, where the Timetable on the Home page was loading in two columns - this was changed to load into two columns at the large Breakpoint (992px) instead of the medium (768px), providing a better viusal experience at these sizes.

There is still some issues at extreme screen sizes (2000+ px), with the content being centered in the middle of the screen, but this seems to be due to the Containers the content is stored in being capped in size at 1980px. However, as the average screen size seems to be 1980x1080, this is not a priority issue, as it is unlikely to come up in the websites theoretical regualr use.
