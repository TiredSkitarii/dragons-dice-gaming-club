## UX

### Ideal user
There are two types of ideal user for this website - a New Visitor and an Existing Member. However, of the two, the New Visitor is the priority focus of the site, as existing Members can be expected to already know many of the details about the Clib, and only be visiting the site for updates on the Events page, while a New Visitor represents a potential new member to the club.

**The ideal New User:**
- A Tabletop Games player who engages with one or more gaming systems
- Disposable income (so they can afford the club fees)
- enough free time to be able to attend activities

**A Visitor to this site is looking for:**
- A gaming club they can join to play tabletop games
- information on both the club itself and any events being run

**This project acheives these goals by:**
- Providing information on the Club and what it offers a prospective new member
- Details on the Clubs' regular activities, including a timetable
- A link to a simple contact form to sign up to the club
- A seperate page detailing upcoming events being run by the club, with links to sign up for the event

## Features

Each page features a Responsive Navigation bar (Nav Bar) that collapses on smaller screens. The Clubs Logo is positioned on the left side of the bar and contains a link which leads back to the homepage, with the navigation links on the right hand side. The Nav Links collapse into the classic "Burger" icon on smaller screens, and the active page is highlighted on the Nav Bar.

**Home**

The Home page, referred to as the Index page within the code, is the main page of the website, and serves the main purpose of providing all the information about the club for prospective new members.

After an introductory, welcoming paragraph, the Header of the Home page contains a Carousel of Images featuring images of several of the game systems that are available to be played at the club. The intention of the image carousel is to catch viewers interest, and prompt them to keep viewing the webpage if they see anything that interests them

The next section is titled "About Us" and is a explanatory paragraph outlining the general purpose of the club - providing a communal environment for tabletop gamers to play games together - and providing an example of some of the many games systems supported at the club. It also outlines the Charity work done by the Club, as well as offering a call to action to submit any questions using the contact link in the Nav bar
This section includes a Stock Image of people playing a Card Game before a new section detailing the Club's values and commitment to inclusivity.
finaly, the section concludes with a breakdown of the benefits of membership of the club, the costs involved, and ends with a call to action with a button linking to the contact form to sign up to the club

The following section contains information on the clubs regular meeting place, St Mary's hall - a Village hall rented by the club. As well as two images of the exterior and interior of the hall, the section also includes a description of the facilities available at the hall, as well as information relavant to club gaming activities (the availability of terrain to use)

The final section of the main element details the clubs regular activities, explaining what those activities ential and providing a timetable displaying what days and at what times the activties run. There is also a breif disclaimer about entry fees for non-members (intended to promote joining the club as a way to save money on regular attendance)

The Contact form is a standardised form that allows users to message Dragon's Dice gaming club, to join the club, join an event, sign up for the newsletter or even just ask a question.

The Contact form consists of four fields, all of which are required to successfully submit the form - the Users name, a contact email address for them, the reason for contacting them, and the content of the message itself - all of these are text fields are text entry fields, except for the contact reason, which is a drop down listing the most common reasopns for contact: Sign up to club, sign up for Newsletter, Sign up for an event or Question/other message.
Filling out and Submiting the form through the Submit button will take the user to the Success page.

The Contact form does not contain the usual footer, as it is not a "main" webpage - rather than contain information to be browsed, it has a direct purpose in enabling contact with the Club's admin team, so is focused solely on that.

**Success**

The Success Page is a simple page acknowledng the successful submission of the Contact Form, and prompting the User to return to the Home page via a link.
