      <p>We are based out of St Mary's Hall in Portishead, on the outskirts of the town by St Mary's Church. The Hall itself has tables to run five-six games simultaneously, as well as on-site parking and an site kitchen with tea, coffee and snacks available for purchase.<br>Dragons Dice Gaming club provides several boxes of terrain for use in games, covering a range of styles and systems, but we recommend people bring their own terrain when they can - It let's us run more tables of games and besides, the more terrain the cooler the game looks! </p>
